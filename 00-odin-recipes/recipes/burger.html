      These vegetarian mushroom burgers are as close as I've ever gotten to
      delicious meatless burgers. Mushrooms really give them a meaty flavor. I
      like to serve them on fresh hamburger rolls with spicy mayonnaise and a
      little lettuce.

    <h2 class="ingrediants">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>3 (8 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>⅔ cup rolled oats</li>
      <li>½ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Oregano cheese</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="instruction">Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
        mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano; cook and stir until
        mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated,
        about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet.</li>
      <li>
        Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in
        bread crumbs and oats, and season with salt and pepper as needed. Stir
        in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread crumbs
        have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to
        form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat.
        Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet until golden brown and cooked
        through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.
      </li>
    </ol>
